<p>I have never written a bio before in Markdown, but I like trying new things. I don't always have much to say and consider myself to be more of one who listens. I like to observe and take in my surroundings analyzing the littlest of details. I value rich experiences and position myself as a conessure of all things. I am an Ogden native, yet I have traveled to multiple states, countries, and continents. I have married the love of my life and don't understand why I have been so lucky to find her. Someone asked me recently what I like to do for fun. I paused to think, and the first things that came out of my mouth was "hanging out with friends." I really don't mind what it is that I am doing, as long as the people I care about are there too. There is however, one relationship that exceeds above all others, and that is the one with my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Religion didn't save me, Jesus did.</p>

<p>I am the Founder and CEO of Hawk Design. For as long as I can remember I have had a love for drawing, stories, and seeing a better future. As I grew up I began to narrow my creative focus and career orientation to Visual Communication. I thoroughly enjoy listening to people tell stories of who they are, where they have been and where they desire to be. Stories are at the root of humankind. I dare say that business are the same. Every business has a story and I want to tell them, this kind of storytelling is "Branding." </p>

<p>The youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow. I have found great appreciation for all the people that I looked up to that were willing to invest their time into me, mentor me. They invested in me, so that I might grow and give back. I want to share with the rising generations the things that I have come to find out and hopefully steer them towards the Life that is found in Jesus. </p>
